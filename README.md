# Snoonu – Daily Planning & Multi-Vertical Adoption

## Live Demo
https://YOUR-VERCEL-LINK.vercel.app

This prototype reimagines Snoonu as a daily-life planning assistant rather than a single-use food app.

## Problem
Most users start with Food & Groceries but never explore other Snoonu services, limiting engagement and long-term value.

## Solution
A contextual planning experience that encourages users to adopt 2+ services by:
- Suggesting relevant services based on time, day, and events
- Guiding users with a simple “Your afternoon, handled” plan
- Rewarding exploration with points and unlockable offers
- Building habits through routines and streaks
- Enabling organic sharing of plans

## Key Features
- Event-aware recommendations
- Multi-vertical activation tracking
- Gamified rewards and offers
- Saved routines for recurring needs
- Shareable daily plans

## Why This Matters
Multi-vertical users order more, stay longer, and generate significantly higher GMV than single-vertical users.  
This solution increases adoption without additional marketing spend.
